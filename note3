Subject: Expression of Interest and Value Proposition
Dear [Manager's Name],
I trust this email finds you well. I recently had the pleasure of interviewing with you for the position_______, and I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the opportunity.
I have thoroughly enjoyed my current role, where we benefit from various provisions such as protection from layoffs, dedicated time for self-study or pursuing hobbies, a stipend of Â£5000 for any course of our choice, and the opportunity for three rotations. However, our take-home compensation in this Explorer program stands at around 50% of the similar roles in other financial companies recruiting through IIT campus placements.
While I have cherished my time in my current role, I am now eager to explore new horizons and believe that the challenges and opportunities within your team align with my career aspirations. However, I must candidly express that the decision to transition hinges on the provision of sufficient incentives.
Given the chance to be a part of your team, I am confident that I can contribute significantly through my technical skillsets, keen attention to detail, and rapid learning ability. I have demonstrated my proficiency in preparing reports using MS Word as well as LaTeX  (which increases speed while dealing with complex equations, tables, and detailed indices). I believe these skills would enable me to generate high-quality reports at an accelerated pace, thereby positively impacting the team's overall productivity.
Thank you for considering my application, and I eagerly await your valuable feedback.
Best Regards,
