I am writing to seek approval to share this photo, which includes our company's logo, on my LinkedIn profile. I would like to clarify that this photo does not contain any sensitive data or confidential information. Furthermore, I've noticed that Barclays India's official LinkedIn account has already posted several photos from the same event, which suggests a willingness to share event-related content that includes our logo.

Sharing this photo on my LinkedIn profile is important to me as it not only serves as a cherished memory in my professional journey but also highlights the positive experiences and opportunities available at our company. It can also underscore our organization's commitment to engaging with employees and showcasing a vibrant work culture.

I am mindful of the importance of maintaining a professional and respectful online presence. Therefore, I am eager to ensure that any post aligns with our company's values and guidelines.

With that in mind, I kindly request your approval and any guidance or specific steps necessary to share this photo on my LinkedIn profile, given that it features our company logo.
