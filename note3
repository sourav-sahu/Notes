I trust this message finds you well. I appreciate the opportunity to interview for the BA4 role recently. Our discussion provided valuable insights into the expectations and responsibilities associated with the position.

Upon reflection, I would like to express my sincere interest in being considered for the BA5 role within the team. I believe that my background and skills align well with the requirements of this position, particularly in terms of client management capabilities.

During my tenure as a Site Reliability Engineer in ESaaS, I had the privilege of working in a highly client-facing role. Collaborating with over 10 clients, I was able to establish positive relationships and deliver successful outcomes. Notably, my performance and mindset were acknowledged by three clients, further attesting to my ability to meet and exceed client expectations.

In my current role as a Software Engineer, I have continued to build on my client management skills. One noteworthy recognition comes from a client in the Run the Bank business unit, underscoring my commitment to excellence in service delivery.

I would also like to draw attention to my recent achievement at Barclays Pune in October 2023. Securing the 1st position in the competition focused on "Developing Technology on the Future of Banking," I had the opportunity to showcase my work to Barclays UK leadership and Executive members in person. This accomplishment was acknowledged at the director level, highlighting my capacity as an agile professional with the ability to communicate complex ideas effectively at the highest organizational levels.

Considering these experiences and recognitions, I am confident in my ability to contribute significantly to the BA5 role. I understand that the transition involves additional responsibilities, and I am eager to embrace these challenges and continue delivering value to our clients and the organization.

I kindly request your reconsideration for the BA5 role, taking into account my proven track record in client management and the strategic perspectives I bring to the table. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to the success of the team in this elevated capacity.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am open to further discussion or providing additional information as needed.
