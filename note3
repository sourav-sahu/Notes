I hope you are going great. I am currently in my second rotation of the Graduate Explorer program here. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in the program, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
During my rotations, I have gained valuable skills of a FullStack developer, with a primary focus on Backend development using Java with testing libraries like Junit and Mockito and Java-based modules like Spring Boot, as well as experience with databases on Elastic Stack and frontend development with ReactJS.
One of my long-term career goals is to relocate abroad, and I am aware that your team may have opportunities for the same.
I would request you to provide me with information about any current or upcoming vacancies in your team that sponsor visas for international candidates
